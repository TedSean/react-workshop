# MSD React Workshop Series

Are you familiar with React and JavaScript basics and would you like to get better?

Join us in our MSD React Workshop Series. It will be a set of independent workshops focused on advanced React and other topics related to web development. Every session will consist of a mix of a talk and live coding. We encourage you to bring a laptop and code with our fellow developer-lecturer. Apart from the laptop you will need a basic understanding of React, JavaScript and web development as we will not cover fundamentals and jump right into more advanced topics.

Please run `npm audit` before using any of our examples at a later date (the 3rd party dependencies might receive important security updates).
